Introduction

Mahindra First Choice Services (MFCS) is a company of Mahindra Group and is India’s leading
chain of multi-brand car workshops with over 335+ workshops present in 267+ towns & 24
states. It has serviced over 10,50,000 cars. The company aims to establish countrywide network
of over 400 workshops by March 2018.
Mahindra would now like to leverage the data that they have and address the key issues they
have. Read along to know how you can help them improve their business.

The dataset consist of three aspects:

1. Customer data: where the details of the customer like the car owned, state and place
of residence, order type, etc are present. Data dimension is of 534000 Customer entries
2. Invoice data: where information related to customer visits and transactions are
recorded, whether a customer as insurance claims, bifurcation of the amount paid, for
what type of service did the customer came for, etc…
3. Material Inventory: where information related to what kind of service did the
customer took and what kind of material was used to service, Labor information
and the cost for the service, Plant and plant name where the customer took the
service.

Objective

Geolocation Based Customer Analysis:

The idea is to explore how various factors like car make & model, time and type of service etc.
vary with location. Since the servicing industry is local in nature, this kind of an analysis could
possibly render some really interesting business insights.

Furthermore, this analysis will enable us to formulate more concrete machine learning problems.
From the data at hand it is possible to extract insights about customer behaviour.

Market Segmentation:

Market segmentation is the process of dividing a market of potential customers into internally
homogeneous and mutually heterogeneous groups or segments, based on different
characteristics captured in the data. Groups created through such a segmentation exercise
many times reveal behavioral patterns which are different from generally accepted segments by
the business. The exercise is broadly known as “clustering” and is aimed at finding the
consumers who will respond similarly to various stimuli by detecting underlying behavior
patterns .

Though clustering falls under a Machine Learning problem category called unsupervised
learning, which requires extensive efforts, it is possible to carry out a visual analysis in a
relatively short timespan.
