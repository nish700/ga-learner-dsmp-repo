### Project Overview

 In the project , we have implemented Inferential Statistics to identify the trueness of a Hypothesis related to bank data.  Proposing a Hypothesis and checking if the Null Hypothesis can be rejected  on the basis of certain parameters.



**A brief descripton of the dataset being used for the project:**

It has data of 9578 customers with the following 15 features:

**customer.id**:	ID of the customer

**credit.policy:**	If the customer meets the credit underwriting criteria of LendingClub.com or not

**purpose**:	The purpose of the loan(takes values :"creditcard", "debtconsolidation", "educational", "majorpurchase", "smallbusiness", and "all_other").

**int.rate:**	The interest rate of the loan

**installment:**	The monthly installments owed by the borrower if the loan is funded

**log.annual.inc:**	The natural log of the self-reported annual income of the borrower

**dti:**	The debt-to-income ratio of the borrower (amount of debt divided by annual income)
