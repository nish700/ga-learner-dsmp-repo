### Project Overview

 This project involves finding out the importance of web pages with the help of Google's PageRank algorithm.

Pagerank is the algorithm employed by Google to sort webpages without human evaluation of the content.


If you've ever created a web page, you've probably included links to other pages that contain valuable, reliable information. By doing so, you are affirming the importance of the pages you link to. Google's PageRank algorithm stages a monthly popularity contest among all pages on the web to decide which pages are most important. The fundamental idea put forth by PageRank's creators, Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page, is this: the importance of a page is judged by the number of pages linking to it as well as their importance.
