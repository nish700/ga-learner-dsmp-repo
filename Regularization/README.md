### Project Overview

 Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in datasets. It does so by reducing the magnitude of the coefficients of the attributes. The more the magnitude of the coefficient, the more its predictive power. 

**About the dataset:**

**Feature	**Description

**Rooms**	Number of rooms

**Type**	Property type

**Price**	Price in dollars

**Method**	Property status

**SellerG**	Real Estate Agent

**Distance**	Distance from CBD

**Postcode**	Code of the area

**Bathroom**	Number of Bathrooms

**Car**	Number of carspots

**Landsize**	Land Size

**BuildingArea**	Building Size

**YearBuilt**	The year in which home was built

**CouncilArea**	Governing council for the area

**Longtitude**	The angular distance of a place east or west

**Regionname**	General Region (West, North West, North, Northeast …etc)

**PropertyCount**	Number of properties that exist in the suburb



**Following concepts have been implemented in the project:**

•	Train-test split

•	Correlation between the features

•	Linear Regression

•	Polynomial Regressor

•	Lasso Regressor

•	Ridge Regressor

•	R2 Evaluation Metrics
