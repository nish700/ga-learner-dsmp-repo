### Project Overview

 In the project , we work on the dataset to bring about insights from the data using python library Matplotlib. Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible. You can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc., with just a few lines of code

The data used in the project pertains to Superhero Statistics . The rise of superheroes and supervillains is at an all time high. The 'Academy of Super Beings(ASB)' was formed to bring order to it. We have with us the data of more than 500 super humans but we need your knowledge of descriptive statistics in figuring out the important insights from it.. 

In this project, we are applying the following concepts:
•	Bar plotting
•	Boxplot plotting
•	Pie-chart plotting
•	Subplot operations
•	Feature Correlation
•	IQR operations
