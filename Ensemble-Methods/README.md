### Project Overview

 **Problem statement**

Determine if the instance is a crater or not a crater. 1=Crater, 0=Not Crater

**Approach:**

-  Load the dataset

-  Preprocessing ( null values handling)

-  Normalise the values to fall between 0 & 1

-  Fit the data to Logistic Regression model and calculate the roc_auc score( area under the roc auc curve) 

-  Higher the value of area under curve better is the model in classification.

-  Fit the data to DecisionTreeClassifier and RandomForestClassifer .

-  Calculate the ROC score.

-  Initialise BaggingClassifer with DecisionTreeClassifier as the base estimator and calculate the roc score

-  Initialise the VotingClassifier with LogisticRegression , DecisionTreeClassifier , RandomForestClassifier as the estimators and calculate the roc score.

- We see there is improvement in accuracy score and the Voting Classifier gives the best roc score of all the models.


**About the dataset**

Using the technique described by L. Bandeira (Bandeira, Ding, Stepinski. 2010.Automatic Detection of Sub-km Craters Using Shape and Texture Information) we identify crater candidates in the image using the pipeline depicted in the figure below. Each crater candidate image block is normalized to a standard scale of 48 pixels. Each of the nine kinds of image masks probes the normalized image block in four different scales of 12 pixels, 24 pixels, 36 pixels, and 48 pixels, with a step of a third of the mask size (meaning 2/3 overlap). We totally extract 1,090 Haar-like attributes using nine types of masks as the attribute vectors to represent each crater candidate. The dataset was converted to the Weka ARFF format by Joseph Paul Cohen in 2012.
 
**Attribute Information:**

We construct a attribute vector for each crater candidate using Haar-like attributes described by Papageorgiou 1998. These attributes are simple texture attributes which are calculated using Haar-like image masks that were used by Viola in 2004 for face detection consisting only black and white sectors. The value of an attribute is the difference between the sum of gray pixel values located within the black sector and the white sector of an image mask. The figure below shows nine image masks used in our case study. The first five masks focus on capturing diagonal texture gradient changes while the remaining four masks on horizontal or vertical textures.

**How to read an image ?**

Python supports very powerful tools when comes to image processing.Matplotlib is an amazing visualization library in Python for 2D plots of arrays. Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack. It was introduced by John Hunter in the year 2002. We will use Matplotlib library to convert the image to numpy as array.
•	We import image from the Matplotlib library as mpimg.
•	Use mpimg.imread to read the image as numpy as array.

** INPUT **
import matplotlib.image as mpimg
<div class="w-percent-100 flex-hbox flex-cross-center flex-main-center">
          <div style="width:100%" class="flex-auto">
            <div style="width:100%; max-width:100%; overflow: hidden "><p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/ga-commit-live-prod-live-data/account/b92/11111111-1111-1111-1111-000000000000/b-43/9301164e-92b3-4f64-b699-737433839cd8/file.png" alt="tile" /></p></div>
          </div>
        </div>

image = mpimg.imread('crater1.png')

NOTE : The images of the crater has already been converted to numpy array and is provided.
