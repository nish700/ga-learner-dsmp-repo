### Project Overview

 **Clustering**

Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). It's a type of Unsupervised machine learning.

**Type of Clustering**

•	Connectivity-based clustering (hierarchical clustering)

•	Centroid-based clustering (K-Means Clustering)

•	Distribution-based clustering

•	Density-based clustering


**Applications of clustering**

•	Preprocessing step for supervised methods

•	Stand-alone tool to get insight into data

•	Knowledge discovery in data (underlying patterns, rules etc)


**Problem Statement**

Customer segmentation lies at the heart of every consumer facing business nowadays which involves being able to identify different types of customers and then figuring out ways to find more of those individuals i.e. get more customers.

With the help of K-Means clustering and observe how you can form groups of customers exhibiting similar behaviour.

**About the dataset**

You have a dataset consisting of two sheets, with names OfferInformation and Transactions. OfferInformation has 32 rows and 7 columns while Transactions has 324 rows and 3 columns.


**Feature	    Description**

**Offer #**	       Order ID

**Campaign**      Month of the campaign

**Varietal**	       Grape variety

**Minimum Qty(kg)**	   Minimum quantity ordered in kgs

**Discount(%)**	     Discount on that order

**Origin**	            Country where the variety of grape is grown

**Past Peak**	     If wine flavor has faded



**Following concepts have been implemented in the project:**

•	Data Manipulation

•	Dimensionality Reduction Technique with PCA

•	KMeans clustering

•	Interpreting clusters with visualization
